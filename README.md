## Cross-browser extension for DeepL translations

This extension was created as a demo project for cross-browser extensions as discussed in [c't Magazin](https://ct.de/), probably issue 25/2017. It works with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, and possibly some lesser-known Chromium browsers. Edge users have to install the version in the `edge` directory (it only differs in one line in manifest.json).

I'm deeply sorry for the ugly icon.

### How to use it

After installing, select text in a browser tab and click the extension icon or the context menu. The extension sends the text to [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) and puts the results in a bubble near the selection.
